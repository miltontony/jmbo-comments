== JMBO Comments ==

Jmbo Comments was built to remove the table `joins` accumulated by the method of
extensibility provided in Django's Comments: Inhertiance.

Traditionally you would inherite from `Comments,` which would accrue a join, so 
we've inherited directly from `BaseCommentAbstractModel` and provided the 
fields that you might require.

In addition we've made the following choices:

- You _could_ do nested comments via the `parent` field.
- Our views don't allow Anonymous comments.
- Removed the `user_*` fields.
- Added `like_count` and `like_users` to be more social.
